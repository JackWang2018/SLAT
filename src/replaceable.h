     * This template class is intended to be improve efficiency by allowing an
     * object in a simulation to change, and notify other affected objects of
     * the change. This allows only the affected objects to clear their caches,
     * minimising calculations when updating results.
     *
     * To implement a Replaceable class, be sure to call notify_change()
     * whenever the object changes so as to affect clients. 
     *
     * To use a Replaceable object, include a shared_ptr to it in your class,
     * and install callbacks (via add_callbacks()). The changed_cb will
     * typically clear the cache; if the client is also Replaceable, it will
     * notify its clients of the change.  The replace_cb needs to replace the
     * shared_ptr with the object provided; it will also typically clear the
     * cache (and, if the client is Replaceable, notify its clients of the
     * change).
