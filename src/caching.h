 * @brief  Facilitates for caching function results.
 *
 * This module provides template classes for functions and values. When a
 * function or value is expensive to calculate, caching it can reduce the
 * overall amount of computational effort required by the program. 
 *
 * When a template is instantiated, it is given a std::function<> object,
 * which will calculate the cached function or value.
